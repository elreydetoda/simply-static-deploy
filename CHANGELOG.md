## v1.0.0 (2020-04-16)

The plugin version was bumped from `v0.2.x` to `v1.x.x` to improve updating via Composer, due to restrictions in the [caret version range](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#caret-version-range-). From the docs:

> For pre-1.0 versions it also acts with safety in mind and treats `^0.3` as `>=0.3.0 <0.4.0`.
